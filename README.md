Coming soon to Heroku! To run this app in the meantime:

1) Follow the instructions for hosting the back-end on your local server:
https://github.com/critsmet/eatup-back-end

2) Fork and clone this respository, run npm install, and then npm start.

3) The log-in page is only for demonstration and has no real authentication--use whatever string you'd like. What you enter as your e-mail address will be required to future logins. 

4) Enter several locations to find a place to eat in the middle of all of them!
